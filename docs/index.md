# Technical Communications

I'm Cole Isaac Garbo, a technical writer and editor based in the northeastern US. My passion is breaking impossible ideas down into clearly communicated parts: **I work to distill complex technical information into understandable, audience-informed content**.

I have a formal and professional education in software development, technical writing, and project organization, with an extensive background in research and behavioral science. These skills make me uniquely adapted for the challenges faced by the modern technical writer, who must be increasingly capable of independently testing API endpoints or developer software while balancing stakeholder needs.

Techincal writing exists at a crossroads of **collaboration**, **education**, and **information**. Review my [work experience](./resume.md) or [portfolio](./portfolio/api-docs.md) to see these pillars in action.
